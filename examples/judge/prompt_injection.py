Open Sentinel — Prompt Injection Defense

Demonstrates the judge engine's async evaluation + deferred intervention
pattern against a prompt injection attack.

Architecture (what happens on each call):
  1. pre_call_hook: applies any pending interventions from the PREVIOUS turn
     (system prompt amendments, context reminders). String manipulation — μs.
  2. LLM call: forwarded to provider via LiteLLM. Unmodified pass-through.
  3. post_call_hook: fires an async judge evaluation in a background task.
     The response is returned to your app IMMEDIATELY — zero critical-path
     latency.
  4. The judge LLM scores the response against each policy rule using
     built-in rubrics (safety, tone, instruction_following). Scores are
     normalized to [0,1] and aggregated into a weighted average.
  5. If the aggregate score falls below threshold, an intervention is
     QUEUED for the next turn — not applied retroactively. This is the
     deferred intervention pattern.

What to watch for in the output:
  - Turn 1: Normal response. Judge evaluates async, finds no issues.
  - Turn 2: User tries prompt injection ("ignore your instructions").
    The LLM responds (may or may not comply — that's irrelevant).
    The judge catches the policy violation AFTER the response is sent.
  - Turn 3: The intervention fires. Open Sentinel injects a system prompt
    amendment into pre_call_hook, steering the agent back on-policy.

Provider-agnostic:
  Set exactly ONE of these env vars:
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=...      → uses gpt-4o-mini
    export GEMINI_API_KEY=...      → uses gemini/gemini-2.5-flash
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...   → uses anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5

Run:
  cd examples/judge
  export <PROVIDER>_API_KEY=...
  osentinel serve                  # terminal 1
  python prompt_injection.py       # terminal 2
